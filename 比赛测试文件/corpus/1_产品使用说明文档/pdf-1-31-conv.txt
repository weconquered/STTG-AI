It may experience problems cleaning soft  oors, such as carpet or rugs. If you use the robot on a carpet or rug, please stay close by the  rst time to see if the robot can deal with this type of  oor. The robot also needs supervision when you use it on black and shinyhard  oors.How your robot cleansCleaning systemThe robot has a 3-stage cleaning system to clean your  oors ef ciently.- The two side brushes help the robot clean in corners and along walls.They also help to work dirt loose from the  oor.ENGLISH 7  12 3                                         54   125 43              
8 ENGLISH- The suction power of the robot picks up loose dirt and transports it through the suction opening into the dust container.- The robot comes with a dry wipe holder that allows you to clean your hard  oor even more thoroughly with dry wipes.Cleaning patternsIn its auto cleaning mode, the robot uses an automatic sequence of cleaning patterns to clean each area of the room optimally.The cleaning patterns it uses are:1 Z-pattern or zigzag pattern2 Random pattern3 Wall-following pattern4 Spiral patternDuring auto cleaning, the robot uses these patterns in a  xed sequence: 1 Z-pattern2 Random pattern3 Wall-following pattern4 Spiral pattern- When the robot has completed this sequence of patterns, it startsmoving in Z-pattern again.The robot continues to use this sequence of patterns to clean the room until the rechargeable battery is empty, or until it is switched off manually.- If the robot detects a particularly dirty area during its cleaning run,it switches to spiral mode and to turbo fan speed to ensure thorough dirt removal.Note:You can also select each mode individually by pressing the appropriate button on the remote control or pointer (FC8820 only). For more details, see chapter ‘Using your robot’, section ‘Cleaning modes’.                      
How your robot avoids height differences- The robot has three drop-off sensors in its bottom. It uses these drop-off sensors to detect and avoid height differences such as staircases.Note: It is normal for the robot to move slightly over the edge of a height difference, as its front drop-off sensor is located behind the bumper.Caution: In some cases, the drop-off sensors may not detect a staircase or other height difference in time.Therefore monitor the robot carefully the  rst few times you use it, and when you operate it near a staircase or another height difference.Before  rst useMounting the side brushes1 Unpack the side brushes and place the robot upside down on a table or on the  oor.2 Push the side brushes onto the shafts on the bottom of the robot.Note: Make sure you attach the side brushes properly. Press them onto theshaft until you hear them lock into position with a click.Inserting the rechargeable battery into the robotYou have to insert the rechargeable battery before use.1 Press the ribbed sections on the battery cavity cover to unlock it.2 Slide the battery cavity cover off the robot.3 Remove the plastic from the rechargeable battery.ENGLISH 9                                                                        2 1          
   10 ENGLISH4 Place the rechargeable battery into the battery cavity.Note: Make sure that the print on the battery points upwards and thatthe connectors point in the right direction.5 Slide the battery cavity cover back onto the robot.Removing the protection tag from the remote controlThe remote control works on a CR2025 coin-shaped battery.This battery is protected with a protection tag that has to be removed before use.1 Pull the battery protection tag out of the battery compartment of the remote control., Now the remote control is ready for use.
