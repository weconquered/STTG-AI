Reference TypesSymbolMethod of DeterminationThis is the value (expressed in μm) measured from the deepest valley to the highest peak of the reference line, l, extracted from the profile.(Disregard unusually high peaks and deep valleys as they are considered as flaws.)Descriptive Figure       m Ry   From the profile, extract a portion to be the reference line, l.Select the 5 highest peak and 5 deepest valleys. Measure the distance between the two lines and express it in μm.    m              Rz      This method is to obtain a center line between the peaks and valleys within the reference line, l.Fold along the center line to superimpose the valleys against the peaks.

Turning Guidance  ■ Factors on Chip Control & Their Influences  ● Influence On The Cutting Speed & Feed● Influence Of The Feed & Cutting Depth● Influence Of The Nose Radius● Influence Of The Side Cutting Edge Angle● Influence On The Rake Angle- The effective range of the chip breaker is reduced with the cutting speed being increased.- At high speeds and small feedrates, lengthened chips will result.- At high speeds and large feedrates, packed chips will result.- With small depths and small feeds, longer chips will be formed.- With deeper depths and larger feeds, short chips will result.- Chips become unsusceptible to breakage when the nose radius is larger and the cutting depth is less.- Chips become thinner as the nose radius gets larger but their control is poor.- If the side cutting edge angle becomes larger, the outlet angle and chips become larger and thinner respectively which makes the difficult to control.- Chips become thicker when the rake angle gets smaller but they are easier to control.For Small Top Rake Angle (α1) - The shear angle is small (φ1) - The chip is thick (t1)Workpiece : S45C (Hs38)Insert : SNMG120408N-UX Holder : PSBNR2525-43Cutting Conditions:d = 3 mmWorkpiece : S45C (Hs38)Insert : SNMG120408N-UX Holder : PSBNR2525-43Cutting Conditions:V = 150 m/minWorkpiece : S45C (Hs38)Insert : CNMG1204     N-UX Holder : PCLNR2525-43Cutting Conditions:V = 120 m/minf = 0.3 mm/revWorkpiece : S45C (Hs38)Insert : SNMG120408N-UX Holder: PSBNR2525-43(Side Cutting edge angle 15°) PSSNR2525-43(Side Cutting edge angle 45°)Cutting Conditions:V = 150 m/mind =3mmFor Large Top Rake Angle (α2) - The shear angle is large (φ2) - The chip is thin (t2)              T8Turning

Milling Guidance ■ Influences of Cutting Edge Geometries ● Various Cutting Angles & Their Functions     DescriptionCodeFunctionsInfluencesRake angles can vary from positive to negative (large to small)with typical combinations of positive and negative, positive and positive or negative and negative configurations.The effect of the large approach angle is to reduce the chip thickness and cutting force.- With a positive (large) angle, cutting ability and adhesion resistance are improved but the strength of the cutting edge is weakened.- With negative (small) angle, the strength of the cutting edge is improved but chips will tend to adhere more easily.- With a positive (large) angle, the chip removal is satisfactory with less cutting resistance but the strength of the corner is weaker.A smaller clearance angle will produce a better surface finish.Ready Chart for Inclination Angles Axial Rake Angle Radial Rake AngleA.R R.RControls chip removal direction, effects adhesion of the chips and thrust force etc.Approach AngleA.AControls chip thickness and chip removal directionTrue Rake AngleT.AEffective Rake AngleInclination AngleI.AControls chip removal directionWiper Flat Clearance AngleF.AControls surface finish1. 2.3.4.5.6. 7.Clearance AngleControls edge strength, tool life and chattering, etc     Ready Chart for True Rake AnglesTrue Rake Angle TInclination Angle I   Example in using the above chart : Given: A(Axial Rake Angle) = +10° R(Radial Rake Angle) = -30°C(Approach Angle) = 60°Solution: T (True Rake Angle) taken from the chart is = -8° Formula: tan T = tan R.cos C + tan A.sin C● Combinations Of Principal Angles & Their Features Negative - Positive CutterThe effects of the various angle configurations with relation to chip formation and chip removal.A.R : Axial Rake angle R.R : Radial Rake angle A.A : Approach angle: Chip removal direction : Direction of cutterrotation AdvantageDisadvantageApplicationsTypical Cutter (Sample)Chip forms Workpiece: SCM435 Condition :V= 130m/minf = 0.23 mm/tooth d = 3 mmDouble - Positive CutterDouble - Negative CutterEconomical using double sided inserts.Poor Cutting ActionMilling of Cast Iron DNF TypeExample in using the above chart: Given: A(Axial Rake Angle) = -10°R(Radial Rake Angle) = +15° C(Approach Angle) = 25°Solution: I (Inclination Angle) taken from the chart is = -15° Formula: tan I = tan A.cos C - tan R.sin C     Best configuration for chip removal with good cutting actionGood Cutting ActionOnly single-sided inserts are availableLess Cutting Edge StrengthOnly single-sided inserts are available.Suitable for Steels, Cast Irons Stainless Steels, Die Steels, etc.General Milling of Steels Low rigidity workpieceUFO TypeDPG Type       M3 Milling

This is defined as the accuracy or run- out of the teeth of which there are two kinds namely: the Axial Run-out of end cutting edges and Radial Run-out of peripheral cutting edges. Of these two the axial run-out of end cutting edges in particular is an influential factor of surface roughness.a. Axial Run-Out of The End - Comparison With Theoretical and Actual Roughness When Cutting With A General Cutter (Example): Cutting EdgesA difference between the maximum and minimum cutting edge positions projected in the axial direction when rotating with reference at the cutter center.b. Radial Run-Out of The Peripheral Cutting EdgesA difference between the maximum and minimum cutting edge positions projected in the radial direction, when rotating with reference at the cutter center.● Improving Run-Out of teeth:a: Axial Run-Out of End Cutting Edge f: Feed per ToothTheoretical Roughness Actual Roughness- Workpiece: Carbon Steel  - Cutter dia. :160 mm - Depth of Cut : 1mmNo. of Teeth: 6   1. Improve the dimensional tolerance of the inserts.2. Improve the dimensional accuracy of the cutter body and its various components.● Improving Surface Finish: 1. Milling inserts with wiper flatProjecting one of the inserts more than the others so as to act as a wiper.- Inserts with Linear Wiper Flat(Face Angle: approx. 15'~1o)- Inserts with Curved Wiper Flat (Curvature is about 500 mm inradius)2. Built-in Wiper Insert SystemA method in which 1 or 2 inserts with a smooth curved edge (wiper inserts) are projected fractionally more than the others so that the working surfaces are wiped flat. (UFO Type, DNF Type, etc.)3. Where No Wiper InsertsAre AvailableReposition inserts to achieve highest 2, 3 or 4 inserts equispaced around the cutter body so that each such high inserts can precede whatever number of lower inserts. Total feedrate/tooth should not bemore than 80% of wiper flat width.- Accuracy of the inserts:- Surface roughness by cutting edges without wiper flat:- Surface roughness by cutting edges with linear wiper flat:h : Projected Amount of Wiper Insert Steels : 0.03~0.07 mmCast Irons : 0.07~0.12mmf= Feed per one revolutionHc: Surface Roughness by Standard inserts Hw: Surface Roughness by Wiper Inserts(Units: mm)    - Surface Roughness by The Wiper Flat System (Depending On Face Angles) :  - Example Of The Wiper Chip's Effect :- Workpiece: Alloy Steel - Cutter: DPG5160R(Single tooth) - V = 154 m/minf = 0.234 mm/tooth d = 2 mm- Face angles: A = 28'B = 6'- Workpiece: Cast Iron- Cutter: DPG4100R- Insert: SPCH42R- Axial run-out: 0.015 mm - Radial run-out: 0.04 mmV = 105 m/minf = 0.29 mm/tooth (1.45 mm/rev)C: Standard inserts only D: With one wiper insert M4Milling
Milling Guidance ■ Cutter Size & Number of Teeth ● Selection of Cutter Size    1. Engage AngleThe above recommendations are based on a φ150mm cutter of on a 100mm wide steel block.2. Mechanical Rigidity3. Processing TimeFeed Direction of WorkpieceThe engage angle (E) is defined as depicted above.- As tool life will be shortened ifE is large therefore a smaller E is preferable.- In order to change E :1. Enlarge the size of themilling cutter.2. Re-position of milling cutter.It is more efficient to select a correct cutter diameter as time can be wasted waiting for the cutter to run off the workpiece if too large a diameter is used.Large Cutter:Small Cutter: WorkpieceOptimum Engage AngleRatio between the diameter of the cutter and the width of the workpieceSteel+20 ~ -103:2Cast IronBelow +505:4Light AlloyBelow +405:3     Machine HorsepowerAdaptive Cutter Size3~5 PS80 ~ 100 mm7.5~10 PS100 ~ 160 mm15~30 PS160 ~ 200 mm     ● Selecting The Number of Teeth 1. Number of Simultaneous Cutting Edges- The minimum number of cutting edges simultaneously engaged in the workpiece should be about 2~4 teeth.- Less than this requirement will cause the work to shift due to impacts which may lead to insert failure or more inferior surface roughness.- More than the requirement may cause deformation of the work, chattering and vibration.2. Work MaterialsD: Nominal diameter of the cutter3. Other Conditions- Relationship Between The Number of Simultaneous Cutting Edges and Cutting Force: 0 or 1 tooth in contact1 tooth constantly in contact1 or 2 teeth in contactConstantly 2 teeth in contact2 to 3 teeth in contact. - Considerations of Work Materials:- Maximize the number of teeth for high feed milling of Cast Irons. (Rigidity of the machine and clamping must be sufficient.)- For steels, the number of teeth should be reduced but feed per tooth should be increased. (Wide chip pockets and rigid cutter body are necessary)- Improve the efficiency of milling non-ferrous alloys by increasing the speed.- Examples Of The Combination Of Typical Cutters & Number Of Teeth  WorkpieceNumber of T eethCutter example and the number of teethSteelDx1~1.5UFO4160 (8 teeth)Cast IronDx2-1~Dx4DHGF4160 (11 teeth)Light AlloyDx1+αAPG4160 (8 teeth)  ApplicationCutter Nominal SizeSteelCast IronLight AlloyHigh FeedUFODHGFAPGDPV (Z)100mm (4")57510160mm (6")811818200mm (8")10151024315mm(12")14231636 1. For narrow workpieces, increase the number of teeth so that at least one tooth is always cutting. 2.

Performance is stable under any cutting speed.- Non-coated endmills are not practical to use at V = 30 m/min because of chipping. Better performance with non-water soluble fluid as cutting speed increases.A more practical cutting speed is 50 m/min but it has a rather limited application range.2) Die-mould Steel (HRC 48)   Findings: - Non-water soluble fluid is slightly better for coated endmills. Performance is basically stable under any cutting speed.- Apparently non-water soluble fluid is more stable for uncoated endmills.At lower cutting speeds, performance is better.Non-water soluble fluids are more practical for uncoated endmills at cutting speeds below 30m/minE7 Endmilling

Their performance was best at around V = 50m/min.- H.S.S endmills work at speeds of less than V = 20m/min but early fracture occurs at over V = 50m/min.Results:- Coated endmills produce an excellentsurface roughness of about 2~3 μm. This is due to the wear resistance of the coated layer.Results:- Coated endmills show the least flankwear and could perform over 3 times better than uncoated endmills.- Uncoated endmills can work only at around V = 30 m/min      ● Excellent Surface Roughness  ● Optimum Machiningfor Hard-to-cut MaterialsE8Endmilling

Drilling Guidance ■ Machine Rigidity ● Machine Capacity1. Power Consumption & Thrust Formula for Multi DrillsCarbide Drills are used for high efficiency cutting. In order to realize their capabilities fully, use rigid and powerful machines.  2. Power Consumption &Thrust Formula for WDS-Drill● SpindleWhen using above chart, please consider the motor power and machine rigidity especially during high efficiency drilling (high thrust) where it requires high rigidity of the spindle. Although it is important to consider the horsepower requirements, the structure and of the main spindle axle is also an important factor for considerations. In general machining centres, rigidity of the machine's configuration are as specified:1) BT50 > BT45 > BT40 2) single axle>plural axleAs high efficiency drilling enhances a large horizontal cutting force in addition to large thrust and torque forces, it is therefore essential to have a rigid and stable clamping.● ClampingPower Consumption = (HB x D0.68 x V1.27 x f0.59) / 36000 Thrust = 0.24 x HB x D0.68 x f0.61Power Consumption (kW) Thrust (kg.f)HB: Brinell Hardness D : Drill DiameterV: Velocity (m/min)f : Feedrate (mm/rev)On the designing the machine, please multiply 1.6 on Power Consumption and 1.4 on Thrust.D5 Drilling

Drilling Guidance ■ Oil Coolant 1. Selection Of Oil2. Features3. Oil SupplyTo maximise the hole accuracy and tool life, the most suitable cutting fluid for MULTI DRILLS is non-water soluble (neat) cutting oil but one must be careful about the development of smoke and fire. Please supply in adequate volume. Neat oil is not suitable at high speeds. (V>40 m/min).At high speeds, the most suitable cutting fluid is water-emulsifiable, high density oil. (7-10 times dilution.) Soluble oil and Chemical fluids are not recommended.  LubricityAdhesion ResistancePermeabilityCooling Rust Smoke Capability Resistance RetardantOdorEmulsifiable Oil      Soluble Oil      Solution Oil        Chlorinated Oil          Water Soluble OilNon Water Soluble OilInternalExternalWork Brake Hose PartLow Carbon Steel (HB150~160)Construction Machine Part Low Carbon Steel (HB150)Machine PartAlloy Steel (HB280)            Sulfo-Chlorinated Oil Higher oil pressure and large amounts of oil are desirable.

Drilling Guidance ■ Relationship Between Hole Depth & Cutting Resistance ● Control the Cutting ResistanceChip removal is very difficult in one-pass deep hole drilling. Clogged chips in the flute makes cutting forces higher and it may lead to drill breakage.Solution by Flute DesignSolution by Step-FeedStep-feeding has two objectives: 1) Chip formation and 2) chip removal.Low speed drilling by HSS, solid carbide or twist drills requires step-feeding [Type 2] to ease chip removal. Conversely, high speed drilling with MultiDrills requires step-feeding [Type 1] to assist in chip formation.  Conventional DesignDeep Hole Application Drill size:φ20mm Material :High Carbon SteelConditions: V = 60m/minf = 0.25mm/rev d = 140mmHorse Power (KW)Design     Normal DrillingStep Feed [Type 1]Step Feed [Type 2] Drill : MDS080MKMaterial :High Carbon SteelConditions: V = 50m/minf = 0.25mm/rev d = 38mm        D9 Drill pathCutting Resistance Thrust T orqueDrilling

Therefore, the cutting resistance, especially thrust force, is high.  The conventional finishing process for hardened steels has been dependent upon grinding but due to the development of CBN tools which provide better capabilities, more and more users are converting to CBN for finishing of hardened steelsMerits of conversion from grinding to cutting: ● Reducing the cutting time.● Reducing the cost of equipment.● Able to perform various operations.  Sintered CBN is a new material for cutting tools which is composed mainly of cubic boron nitride and sintered at ultrahigh pressure andtemperatureSumiBoron is a sintered CBN tool developed by SumitomoHardness Of Tool Materials At High Temperature  < Cutting Quench-Hardened Steels By CBN >  ● Cutting of Quench- Hardened Steels and Tool Life● Comparison Between Surfaces Finished By Grinding & Cutting● Machining Accuracies● Milling & Tool Life ● SumiBoron EndmillExample● SumiBoron Jig Boring Tool ExampleTool Life Diagram In Cutting Carburize- Quenched SteelCutting Conditions:Depth of Cut, 0.2 mm; feed, 0.12 mm/revWet; Tool Configuration, -5,-6,5,6,15,15,0.8RCarbide K10 fails within 2 minutes at 60 m/min, while BN250 has a longer life, some 100 minutes at 100 m/minComparison Between Surfaces Finished By Grinding & Cutting With BN250Workpiece: SNCM8 (HrC50) 840 Oil-Quenched, 200 TemperedBN250 produces an extremely regular and fine surface finish compared to grinding      X8Dimensional Fluctuation in Boring (The workpiece is rotated by a general purpose lathe)No. of cut workpieces Workpiece: SCM415 (HRC65), Tool: SumiBoron BN250cutting Speed: 100 m/min, Depth of Cut: 0.1 mm, Feed: 0.08 mm/rev, Dry SystemThe deviation of hole diameter corresponds to a receded amount of the cutting edges due to tool wear and complies with a tolerance width of Class H7 after cutting 200 pcs.     Tool Life In MillingWorkpiece: SKD61 (HRC65)Tool: Double-NegativeCutting Conditions: Depth of Cut, 0.2 mm; Feed, 0.08 mm/tooth Mean Flank Wear: 0.2 mm ReferenceAn Actual Example of The Sumiboron Jig Boring ToolWorkpiece: Quenched Parts (Precision Boring) Workpiece: SKS3HRC58~50CuttingConditions: V=30m/min d=0.1mm f=0.05mm/rev DryResultsMachiningTime:Surface Roughness (Rmax): 1.7 μm Bore Concentricity :Bore Consistency :An Example Of The Sumiboron Endmill :     T ool:SumiBoronJig Boring Tool SJB1008 (Dia. 8)1/1000 mm 5/1000 (30pcs)0.5min/pcsExotic Mat.Grinding Cutting
